# Direct Ascent Synthesis: Hidden Generative Capabilities in Discriminative Models
A demo for the Direct Ascent Synthesis: Hidden Generative Capabilities in Discriminative Models paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07753)

[This Colab](https://github.com/stanislavfort/Direct_Ascent_Synthesis/blob/main/Direct_Ascent_Synthesis_generation_demo.ipynb) demonstrates
1. Text to image generation
2. "Style" transfer
3. Image reconstruction from its CLIP embedding

What you can expect:
1. Text to image generation for `a photo of a meteor streaking through the night sky, detailed` looking like this
   ![DAS generated meteor](das-demo-generation.png "a title")
2. Its individual resolutions looking like this after generation:
   ![DAS generated meteor](das-demo-resolutions.png "a title")
3. To showcase generation diversity, 4 generations of the `a beautiful photo of Antelope Canyonâ€™s light beams, detailed`
   ![DAS generated meteor](das-demo-many-generations.png "a title")
4. Combining a source image of an SF skyline at night with the Van Gogh "The Starry Night"
   ![DAS generated meteor](das-demo-style.png "a title")
5. And finally reconstructing an image of Henry VIII from its CLIP embedding:
   ![DAS generated meteor](das-demo-reconstructed.png "a title")
6. Get a spectrum of a generated image:
   ![DAS generated meteor](das-demo-spectrum.png "a title")
